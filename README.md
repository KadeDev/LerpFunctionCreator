# LerpFunctionCreator
Lerp Function Creator (LFC) is a simple but powerful tool to create a Linear Interpolation Curve (Lerp Curve) in C++/Lua.

Go on over to the [Releases](https://github.com/KadeDev/LerpFunctionCreator/releases) page to get a Windows Binary.

## Tutorial

### Steps

Steps are a fancy way of saying "If statements," simply put:

They are conditions to alter the graph. Example, if the t (the x cord) is less than 1, take the current t and pow it to itself

Then you could also add another step to subtract everything if it's less than 1 by 0.5 to lower the entire graph.

One thing you will notice is the graph isn't 100% accurate. Mostly because windows forms isn't that great of a graphing tool, sorry about that!

But it should give you the jist of what it would do.

### Finished?

Check out the bottom right for the code. This code should be ready to be pasted into C++ or Lua. You then plug this into a lerp function and then you have your custom lerp!
